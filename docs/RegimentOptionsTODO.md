# FEC - all correct

# Nighthaunt - technically correct
* shows 0-1 black coach and 0-1 black coach (sog). This is technically still correct because sog and normal unit are mutually exclusive list wide.
	* we could deduplicate this and change the logic in the unit picker and validation to consider them the same unit i.e) name === unitName + sog
	* then remove the sog one from reg options
