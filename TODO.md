- Unit weapons that are exclusive with everything. Arkonaut skypike.
- LotFP units special case
- Parse and save AoRs.
  - Do we have the restriction text? We can at least show the restricted unit text.
  - We may need to relink together lores/artifacts/traits etc that are shared.
- save state of all collapse, drop downs and tabs - be smart about it though.
- fix desktop view
- figure out the pattern for units that aren't reinforceable
- support dark mode

- weird issues with companion unit parsing
  - skitterstrand says must be taken with rabble rowza
  - sporesplatta (sog) says must be taken with Droggz da Sunchompa
  - Rabble-Rowza must be taken with Arachnarok Spider with Flinger and Arachnarok Spider with Spiderfang Warparty and Skitterstrand Arachnarok and Aleguzzler Gargant.
  - Droggz da Sunchompa must be taken with Grinkrak's Looncourt and Sporesplatta Fanatics (Scourge of Ghyran) and Loonsmasha Fanatics (Scourge of Ghyran).

  - the simple checks must be too permissive, because these aren't regiment options
