- LotFP units special case (only relevant in AoR and points are in the AorR).
- Parse and save AoRs.
  - Do we have the restriction text? We can at least show the restricted unit text.
  - We may need to relink together lores/artifacts/traits etc that are shared.
- save state of all collapse, drop downs and tabs - be smart about it though.
- fix desktop view
- support dark mode
- spinner for page load
- math hammer on warscrolls
- report error in warscroll
- back to top button

- reinforceable todo/fixes:
  - loftp demons can be reinforced (they show as not reinforeable).

- regiment options todos:
  - parse subhero options - this one is fairly easy.
  - figure out how to compute the least common denominator for keywords with other regiment options.
    - need to figure out what we're looking for and gather all possible units
    - then take the difference of all the sets of keywords to find the keyword for the regiment options
    - we also need to compute the allowed amount of the regiment option, any amount (any might actually be 0-4/5) vs 0-1 vs 0-x
